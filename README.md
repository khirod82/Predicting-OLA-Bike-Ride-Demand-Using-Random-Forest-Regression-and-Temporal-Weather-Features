**"Predicting OLA Bike Ride Demand Using Random Forest Regression and Temporal-Weather Features"**

---

### **Inference / Conclusion from the Project:**

This project successfully implemented a **Random Forest Regressor** model to predict the demand (`count`) for OLA bike rides based on a range of features, including:

* **Temporal features** (hour, day of the week, month),
* **Weather conditions** (season, weather type, temperature, humidity, windspeed), and
* **User-related factors** (casual and registered users).

#### Key Insights:

1. **Model Performance:**

   * **R-squared (R²): 0.9998** – The model explains nearly all the variability in ride requests, indicating excellent predictive power.
   * **Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.4207** – Very low error, suggesting high accuracy.

2. **Important Features:**

   * The most influential predictors were **registered users**, **casual users**, and **hour of the day**, implying ride demand is heavily dependent on user behavior and time patterns.

3. **Residual Analysis:**

   * The residual plot and histogram of residuals showed no major pattern or bias, supporting the model’s reliability.

4. **Predicted vs Actual Values:**

   * The scatter plot showed that predictions closely match the actual values, further validating the model’s accuracy.

5. **Example Prediction:**

   * For a given example with early morning (0 hour), light weather, moderate humidity and temperature, and some casual and registered users, the model predicted **\~16.5 ride requests**.
